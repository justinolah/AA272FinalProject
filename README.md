Code for "Analysis and Modeling of Errors in Multipath Point Locations" Final Project for Stanford University's AA272: Global Positioning Systems
Authors: Justin Olah and Rachel Stutz

For our conversion from LLA to ECEF coordinates, we used the `lla_to_ecef` function from the following public GitHub repository: https://github.com/STEMlib/lla_to_ecef.

To read in raw GNSS logs and convert them to DataFrames, we used and modified the `gnss_log_to_dataframes` function from the following publicly available notebook: https://www.kaggle.com/sohier/loading-gnss-logs.
